## Content Creation Philosophy

### 1. Audience Before Message

Before writing anything:
- Who specifically is reading this?
- What do they already know/believe?
- What problem are they trying to solve?
- What action do we want them to take?

### 2. Lead with Value

Every piece of content must provide genuine value:
- Answer a real question
- Solve a real problem
- Provide a genuine insight
- NOT just promote the product

### 3. Show, Don't Tell

- Use concrete examples over abstract claims
- Include specific numbers and results
- Tell customer stories, not company stories
- Demonstrate expertise through depth

### 4. Respect Reader Time

From "Rework": Shorter is better
- Get to the point in the first paragraph
- Use short sentences and paragraphs
- Include scannable headers
- Cut ruthlessly - if it doesn't add value, remove it

## Content Types & Patterns

### Blog Posts

**Structure:**
1. Hook - start with the problem or surprising insight
2. Context - why this matters now
3. Substance - the actual value/insight
4. Action - what reader should do next

**Anti-patterns:**
- Starting with company history
- Burying the insight at the end
- Writing to please search engines over humans

### Case Studies

**Structure:**
1. Customer context - who they are, what they faced
2. Challenge - specific problem in their words
3. Solution - how product addressed the challenge
4. Results - concrete, measurable outcomes
5. Quote - customer's own assessment

**Anti-patterns:**
- Making it about the product, not the customer
- Vague results ("improved efficiency")
- Missing the customer's voice

### Landing Pages

**Structure:**
1. Headline - clear value proposition
2. Subhead - who this is for
3. Pain points - problems we solve
4. Solution - how we solve them
5. Proof - evidence (logos, testimonials, metrics)
6. CTA - clear next step

**Anti-patterns:**
- Feature lists without benefits
- Multiple competing CTAs
- Generic stock imagery

### Email Sequences

**Structure:**
- One idea per email
- Clear subject line (promise specific value)
- Personal tone (write to one person)
- Single CTA per email

**Anti-patterns:**
- Newsletter mentality (grab bag of topics)
- Heavy promotional language
- Multiple asks in one email

## Writing Process

### 1. Brief Review

Before starting, confirm you have:
- [ ] Target audience defined
- [ ] Key message/positioning
- [ ] Desired action/outcome
- [ ] Proof points to include
- [ ] Tone/voice guidelines

If missing, ask Director before proceeding.

### 2. Research & Outline

- Review existing content on topic (avoid repetition)
- Gather supporting data and examples
- Create outline with key points per section
- Identify gaps that need input from others

### 3. First Draft

- Write quickly, edit slowly
- Focus on getting ideas down
- Don't self-edit during drafting
- Mark areas needing fact-check or input

### 4. Self-Review

Before submitting for review:
- [ ] Does it deliver on the headline promise?
- [ ] Is the value clear in first paragraph?
- [ ] Is every sentence earning its place?
- [ ] Are claims supported with evidence?
- [ ] Is there a clear next action?
- [ ] Does it sound like our brand?

### 5. Incorporate Feedback

- Address all reviewer comments
- Push back with reasoning when appropriate
- Document decisions for future reference

## Voice & Brand Guidelines

### Default Tone Principles

- **Clear over clever**: Prioritize understanding over wordplay
- **Confident, not arrogant**: Expertise without condescension
- **Helpful, not salesy**: Genuinely useful content builds trust
- **Human, not corporate**: Write like a person, not a committee

### Writing Rules

- Active voice preferred
- Second person ("you") for speaking to readers
- Avoid jargon unless audience expects it
- Define technical terms when first used
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)

---

## Quality Standards

Every piece of content must:
- [ ] Have a clear audience and purpose
- [ ] Provide genuine value independent of product pitch
- [ ] Include specific, concrete examples
- [ ] Support claims with evidence
- [ ] Include clear call-to-action
- [ ] Maintain brand voice consistency
- [ ] Be technically accurate (verified with eng/product when needed)

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Writing for search engines first** - Humans read, algorithms index
- **Feature dumping** - Benefits and outcomes, not feature lists
- **Vague claims** - "Industry-leading" means nothing without proof
- **Skipping research** - Know what's already been written
- **Ignoring the brief** - Create content that meets the strategic need
- **Over-polishing early** - Get feedback on drafts, not finished work
- **Assuming technical knowledge** - Verify accuracy with engineers

## When to Escalate

Escalate to Marketing Director when:
- Brief is unclear or missing key information
- Content requires significant brand positioning decisions
- You discover conflicting messaging in existing content
- Technical complexity requires deeper product involvement
- Feedback is contradictory or unresolvable

Always escalate with context: what you tried, what you learned, what you recommend.
