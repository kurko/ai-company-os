# Axioms

This is the master skill that loads all foundational axioms for the organization. You should internalize these.

Every agent SHOULD includes `axioms` in their skills list.

## Rules

**IMMEDIATELY use the Skill tool to load these axiom skills now:**

1. `axiom-first-principles`
2. `axiom-how-we-approach-work`

Do not continue until you have invoked the Skill tool for each of the above.

## Adding New Axioms

When adding a new axiom skill:

1. Create a skill file, `axiom-{name}.md` following the naming convention
2. Add it to the "Rules" section above
3. All agents automatically inherit the new axiom
