# Systems Thinking

Neural triggers for understanding complex systems, flow, and constraints. Reference these to activate trained knowledge.

## Books

### Thinking in Systems
**Author:** Donella Meadows
**Trigger phrase:** "Apply systems thinking principles for..."
**Key concepts:**
- Stocks, flows, and feedback loops
- Leverage points: where to intervene in a system
- Delays cause oscillation and instability
- System boundaries are arbitrary but important
- Emergent behavior from simple rules

**When to invoke:** Analyzing organizational dynamics, understanding unintended consequences, finding high-leverage interventions, process design.

### The Principles of Product Development Flow
**Author:** Donald Reinertsen
**Trigger phrase:** "Apply Reinertsen's flow principles for..."
**Key concepts:**
- Cost of Delay as the key economic metric
- Batch size reduction for faster feedback
- WIP limits and queue management
- Variability is not always bad - manage it, don't eliminate it
- Economic frameworks for prioritization

**When to invoke:** Prioritization decisions, process optimization, WIP management, understanding queuing effects, batch size decisions.

### The Goal
**Author:** Eliyahu Goldratt
**Trigger phrase:** "Apply Theory of Constraints for..."
**Key concepts:**
- The goal is to make money (throughput, not efficiency)
- Identify the constraint - everything else is noise
- Exploit the constraint before elevating it
- Local optimization is the enemy of global throughput
- Drum-Buffer-Rope for flow control

**When to invoke:** Finding bottlenecks, avoiding local optimization traps, process improvement, resource allocation.
