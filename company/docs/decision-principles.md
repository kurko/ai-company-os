# Decision Principles (Tier 0)

All recommendations and decisions pass through these filters.

## Foundations
- **First Principles**: Decompose to fundamentals before building
- **Empiricism**: Data over opinions (Taleb)
- **Falsification**: Seek to disprove, not confirm (Popper)

## Prioritization
- **Pareto**: 80% of value from 20% of effort
- **Opportunity Cost**: What are you not doing by choosing this?

## Risk Assessment
- **Reversibility**: Two-way door decisions move fast; one-way doors require analysis (Bezos)
- **Via Negativa**: What would make this fail? (Munger, Klein)
- **Margin of Safety**: Assume estimates are wrong
- **Second Order**: Consequences of consequences - evaluate the tree

## Resilience
- **Antifragility**: Prefer options that strengthen under stress (Taleb)
