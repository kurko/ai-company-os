# Research: Ideal Board of Directors Structure

## Status
Backlog (Not urgent)

## Context

The system has board agents (`board-chairman.md`, `board-conservative.md`, etc.) representing different thinking styles for strategic oversight. Before building these agents, we should research what makes an effective board composition.

Currently we have placeholder styles:
- Chairman (facilitates)
- Conservative (risk-averse)
- Aggressive (growth-focused)
- Technical (deep technical perspective)
- Customer (market perspective)

But this is intuition-based. Real board composition theory could inform better agent design.

## Research Questions

1. **What perspectives should a well-composed board have?**
   - Financial/fiduciary
   - Industry expertise
   - Operational experience
   - Customer/market insight
   - Technical depth
   - Risk management
   - Growth/scaling experience

2. **What cognitive diversity matters?**
   - Thinking styles (analytical vs intuitive)
   - Time horizons (short-term vs long-term)
   - Risk tolerance spectrum
   - Insider vs outsider perspectives

3. **How do effective boards avoid groupthink?**
   - Mandatory dissent roles
   - Devil's advocate protocols
   - Independent director requirements
   - Rotation and fresh perspectives

4. **What's the ideal board size?**
   - Too few = echo chamber
   - Too many = coordination overhead
   - What's the sweet spot for AI agents?

5. **How do boards delegate to committees?**
   - Audit committee
   - Compensation committee
   - Nominating/governance committee
   - Could these map to sub-agent patterns?

## Sources to Research

- Academic literature on board effectiveness
- Corporate governance best practices (e.g., NACD guidelines)
- Startup board composition (a]6z, YC recommendations)
- Books: "The Board Book" by Susan Shultz, "Corporate Boards" by Harvard Business Review
- Case studies of effective vs dysfunctional boards

## Output

Recommendations for:
1. Which board agent "styles" to create
2. How many board agents is optimal
3. What each board agent's perspective/expertise should be
4. How board agents should interact (committee structure?)
5. When to invoke full board vs individual board members

## Dependencies
- None (research only)

## Priority
Low - current placeholder structure is functional for MVP
